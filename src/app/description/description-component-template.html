<h2>Progress so far</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2016.10.15 managed to run xhr tests with karma/jasmine and mocks $httpbackend server</li>
  <li>started playing with components (only works in angular 1.5.8, not 1.2)</li>
  <li>managed to separate grid model/view into a grid-component, which is now entirely indepenent (except for the colResizable link)</li>
  <li>improved directory structure and cleaned up index html</li>
  <li>
    for karma to run properly 
    npm instal --global 
      karma
      jasmine-core
      karma-jasmine
      karma-chrome-launcher
      angular-mocks
    get all of the dependencies locally and load them into karma conf since these will be needed for testing before the actual specs.
  </li>
</ul>
